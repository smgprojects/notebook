Forked Jason's version, cleaned out his stuff, started building in my own stuff, figuring out how rakefiles work, trying to make this process as clean as possible. I'd like to be able to make links semi-automagically with file names from the posts directory, but the md-writer plugin for atom is not displaying the search posts dialogue, which it seems it ought to be doing. I've filed a ticket.
