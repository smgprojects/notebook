	Abstract = {An artist and a biologist have collaborated on the sonification of protein data to produce the audio compact disc "Life Music." Here they describe the process by which this collaboration merges scientific knowledge and artistic expression to produce soundscapes from the basic building blocks of life. The soundscapes may be encountered as aesthetic experiences, as scientific inquiries or as both. The authors describe the rationale both for the artistic use of science and for the scientific use of art from the separate viewpoints of artist and scientist.},

	Abstract = {A goal of sonification research is the intuitive audio representation of complex, multidimensional data. The authors present two facets of this research that may provide insight into the creative process. First, they discuss aspects of categorical perception in nonverbal auditory scene analysis and propose that these characteristics are simplified models of creative engagement with sound. Second, they describe the use of sonified data in musical compositions by each of the authors and observe aspects of the creative process in the purely aesthetic use of sonified statistical data.},

	Abstract = {The author presents his work in sonifying ocean buoy data for scientific, pedagogical and compositional purposes. Mapping the spectral buoy data to audible frequencies creates interesting and illuminating sonifications of ocean wave dynamics. Several phenomena can be heard, including both those visible and those invisible in graphical representations of the data. The author has worked extensively with this data to compose music and to produce "Music from the Ocean," a multimedia CD-ROM demonstrating the data, the phenomena and the sonification. After a brief introduction to physical oceanography, many examples are presented and a composition and installation created from the sonifications are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Soils surrounding ancient settlements can hold evidence of the activities of past societies. To seek an understanding of how past societies have reacted and contributed to environmental change requires many data sources. The realtime audiovisual installation Ground-breaking problematizes the presentation of such data, gained in this case through the image-analysis of soil materials. These data are used to connote environmental events and consequent human responses. By combining these data with audiovisual synthesis and environmental recordings, the authors present a basis for developing conceptualizations of new locales undergoing environmental change; the visual and sonic narratives that are developed allow the art-science interface to be explored.},

	Abstract = {Sound is a crucial component of the human communicative toolkit; however, as a topic of research, it has been relatively neglected in archaeological method and theory. We propose that a framework requires to be developed in which inferences can be made about the significance of sound in the past that are not bounded by the particularities of current cultural contexts. Such a framework should be multidisciplinary and draw on what is known scientifically about human sensitivities to and uses of sound, including nonverbal vocalizations, speech and music, ethological studies that offer insight into how sound perception and environment affect sociality and survival, and the effects of environment on socially significant human sound.},

@article{rahaman_interpreting_2011,
	Abstract = {Present virtual heritage projects are mostly focused either on `process' or `product' but rarely consider `users' (end-users' perception of the content) with project contents predominantly developed with an `ocular-centric' tendency. There is no significant interpretation method or principle for interpreting digital heritage like other disciplines such as archaeology. This paper argues that, for better interpretation and experience of a digital heritage site, a comprehensive interpretation method is required, which should address end-users with various background, overcome the linearity in narrative level and subjectiveness in content creation. This paper also argues that instead of predetermined instructional sequences or descriptive interpretation, the interaction setting can be participatory and contributive, where the end-users and environment may engage in `dialogic-interaction'. In terms of methodology, `Interpretation' is first conceptualized by assimilating definitions from various heritage scholars and interpretation organizations. Notions of interpretation-practice and level of interaction are identified from reviewing some online digital heritage projects. By identifying weaknesses, this paper finally proposes a conceptual model for developing a comprehensive interpretation method for future digital heritage projects.},

      in the West's Cold War experience and illustrates that this
      era can be understood in terms of two distinct phases, with
      a turning point in the late 1960s/early 1970s. This
      transition saw shifts in relationships between Puget Sound
      residents and the military, from a traditional, almost
      unanimous support for the military's presence in the
      region, to the development of a much more hostile attitude
      among some segments of the public. This change reflected
      growing concerns about the environment and skepticism about
      military-related economic growth. It was also shaped by
      concerns about nuclear weapons and the role of the armed
      services in {U.S.} foreign relations, the result of the
      rebirth of the anti-nuclear movement across the United
      States in the 1970s.},
