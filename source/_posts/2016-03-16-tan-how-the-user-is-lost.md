p151 authors develop  a 3 step model where step 1 'documentation' involves the tangible & intangible, but as we move to step 2 'representation' constraints and distortion lead to data loss, and then as we move to stage 3 'dissemination' we combine 'media' (hardware, software, narrative) which then the user interacts with. The user is the missing aspect - there is no consideration of 'age, cultural background, ideology, perception, psychology, technical skill, learning ability, cognition' in the design of virtual heritage. This model is drawn from ChanLIn 2001, Osberg 199, Roussou 2008.  This is all to say that there is a 'lack of literature focused on the theory and methodology of user interaction and interpretation of heritage' - designers dump information onto the user.
