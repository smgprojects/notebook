A video interview with the linguists who consulted with Ubisoft on the construction of language in 'Far Cry Primal'

## video blurb
John sat down with Andrew Byrd and Brenna Reinhart Byrd, linguistics experts invited by Ubisoft to create two languages for use in Far Cry Primal. The conversation ranged from discussing Andrew and Brenna’s involvement in the development process to the challenges and rewards of seeking an “authentic” approach to recreating historical (and prehistoric) events in works of fiction.
