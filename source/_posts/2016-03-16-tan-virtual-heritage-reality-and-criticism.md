Tan, B.-K., and H. Rahaman. “Virtual Heritage: Reality and Criticism,” 2009. <http://scholarbank.nus.edu.sg/handle/10635/45499>

"To virtualize heritage means to actualize the heritage content digitally and to simulate it using computer graphics technology."  + that's the thing right there, that word 'actualize'. Need to unpack that. p144

> "According to Addison (2000) there are three major domains in virtual heritage:
  - 3D Documentation: everything from site survey to epigraphy
  - 3D Representation: from historic reconstruction to visualization
  - 3D Dissemination: from immersive networked worlds to ‘in-situ’ augmented reality." - p 146
