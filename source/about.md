Hi, I'm Shawn Graham, associate prof in the history department at [Carleton University](http://carleton.ca/history). What you are looking at is a fork of Jason Heppler's [open notebook](http://notebook.jasonheppler.org/). I've been looking for some sort of open notebook [solution](http://electricarchaeology.ca/2015/10/06/an-elegant-open-notebook/) for a while; I like Jason's version. I've added the ability for readers to leave annotations on any part of this notebook using the [hypothesis](https://hypothes.is/) web annotation architecture. See that strip down the right hand side of the page? Click on there to get started!

## What is Open Notebook History?

Like Jason, the example of historian [Caleb McDaniel](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html) is a prime motivation for wanting to do this; in my archaeological life, the example of archaeologist [Mark Madsen](http://notebook.madsenlab.org/labnotebook.html) also figures prominently! Why do this? Well, as Caleb writes, the appeal of open notebooks lies in our

> "scholarly values of open intellectual exchange, integrity, and honesty. . . . Sharing is something that tends to make scholars, qua scholars, happy; presumably it's why we are in the business of writing, speaking, and teaching in the first place.... trash (and treasure) are in the eyes of the beholder: _The truth is that we often donâ€™t realize the value of what we have until someone else sees it._ By inviting others to see our work in progress, we also open new avenues of interpretation, uncover new linkages between things we would otherwise have persisted in seeing as unconnected, and create new opportunities for collaboration with fellow travelers." - Caleb McDaniel

I'm going on sabbatical in 2016; it is my intention to use this notebook to keep track of what I get up to this year.
