### Summary

**Title:** Additive Archaeology: An Alternative Framework for Recontextualising Archaeological Entities

**Subject:** 3: grand disciplinary challenge, 2: real, virtual, and authentic are becoming increasingly unstable, 1: Additive manufacturin

**Key Themes:** 2: a radical new generative framework within which to recontextualise and reconsider the nature of archaeological entities specifically within the domain of digital archaeology, 1: avin Lucas’ characterisation of the archaeological record as a product of contending processes of materialisation and dematerialisation

**Key Literature:** 1: Lucas, G., Understanding the Archaeological Record, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2012.

**The Interesting Bits:**

<ul><li>Materialising8: the material world is, at any given time, an archive of this process of (de)materialization” [3, p.205]</li><li>Materialising7: Complimentary processes (called enchainment or coding) cohere to generate recurring associations such as typological similarities or repeated find combinations.</li><li>Materialising6: Here, depositional processes (called containment or territorialisation) cohere to assemble, or gather, things in specific places</li><li>Materialising5: the practices of the field archaeologist are not so much data collection but interventions, or material interactions, in which tools and procedures are mobilised locally to materialise new entities or artefacts (e.g. drawings, samples, photographs, context sheets, field diaries, finds and reports); it is these new, mobile, dynamic assemblages of autonomous objects that become archives.  </li><li>Materialising4: viewing any one facet in isolation can lead to fundamental disconnects or an “interpretive dilemma, in which explanations often hover between vacuity and incommensurability” [3, p.169].</li><li>Materialising1: the first connotation is that of material culture, materiality or artefacts understood in their broadest sense</li><li>Materialising2: next meaning is expressed in terms of how deposits and assemblages come to be, something he labels as “formation theory</li><li>Materialising3: he archaeological record as constructed in the present, also known as the archive.</li><li>1: For example, Gavin Lucas’ very sophisticated exploration of the nature of the archaeological record elaborates on one central question: “What is the ontological relationship between ‘methodological’ concepts like stratigraphy and typology on the one hand and current ‘theoretical’ notions like materiality and agency on the other” [3, p.3].</li></ul>

### Tabular Representation
<table><tr><th>Observation</th><th>Resonances</th><th>Crossref</th><th>Problems</th></tr><tr><td>materialising8 decisions are made in 'real' archives about what is kept, what is left out. </td><td>I wonder how far the metaphor of the 'archive' can be pushed before it breaks? Before it conceals more than it reveals?</td></tr>
<tr><td>materialising7 'enchainment' is a cool word; seems to suggest an element of coercion, perhaps? This must be Lucas' term.</td></tr>
