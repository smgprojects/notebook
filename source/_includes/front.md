## Welcome

My name is [Shawn Graham](http://electricarchaeology.ca) and I am an associate professor of Digital Humanities in the Department of History at [Carleton University](http://carleton.ca/history). This is my open research notebook for my sabbatical in the 2016-17 academic year. I forked it from [Jason Heppler](http://jasonheppler.org) and where appropriate, I've left in his original comments on how this site all works and the logic of its organization.

You can follow along with my research on this site. The best places to start are:

- [Recent activity](/archive/): listing the most recent additions to the notebook
- [All pages](/archive-alphabetical/): see all pages in the notebook alphabetically

You can be part of my research process too. I've added the ability for readers to leave annotations on any part of this notebook using the [hypothesis](https://hypothes.is/) web annotation architecture. See that strip down the right hand side of the page? Click on there to get started!

Also, check out the project tabs along the lefthand side. I also maintain [GitHub repositories](http://github.com/shawngraham) for other work related to my research and scholarship.

### Active Projects

- [Soundbashing the Past](/soundbashing-history/). The digital humanities privileges the visual. There is however no necessary reason why something like a topic model should be represented by a graph. In this project, I am exploring what different grammars of sonification might be like for representing historical data aurally. NB I'm not talking about archaeoacoustics here or recreating past soundscapes or soundsheds. Rather, I want to take the born-digital results of our data machinations and listen to what they might be tellling us.
- [Archaeogaming](/archaeogaming/) stay tuned!
